                        <strong>So</strong> why are some wines cheap, and others are more expensive? Cheap wines are stock-picked
                        from the vineyards and processed by machinery. The grapes are often damaged or require large amounts
                        of pesticides to help keep rot and decay at bay. Many preservatives are added, lowering sanitation
                        standards and decreasing production costs. When you purchase a cheap bottle of wine, you are paying
                        for pesticides, preservatives, and low quality grapes.
